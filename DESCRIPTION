Description: A self-reprorted health, happines, attitude and other status or
 perception (status hereafter) is often a subject of a bias that may come from 
 different sources. For example, the evaluation of own health may depend on 
 previous medical diagnoses, functional status, symptoms and signs of illness 
 as well as life-style behaviours including contextual social, gender, 
 age-specifc, linguistic and other cultural factors 
 (Jylha 2009 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.013>; 
 Oksuzyan et al. 2019 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002>). 
 The package offers versatile functions to analyze different self-reported 
 ordinal variables and helps to estimate the bias.
 The package delivers the function to fit generalized ordered probit model that 
 regresses the original self-reported status measure on two sets of independent 
 variables (King et al. 2004 <doi:10.1017/S0003055403000881>; 
 Jurges 2007 <doi:10.1002/hec.1134>; 
 Oksuzyan et al. 2019 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002>). 
 In contrast to the standard ordered probit models, the generalized ordered 
 probit model relaxes the assumption that individuals use a common scale when 
 rating their own status and allows for distinguishing between the status 
 (e.g., health) and reporting differences. In other words, the model accounts 
 for heterogeneity in reporting behavior. The first set of variables 
 (e.g., health variables) included in the regression, assesses various specific 
 aspects of individual related directly to self-reported variable. 
 In case of the self-reported health, these could be chronic conditions, 
 mobility level, difficulties with daily activities, performances on grip 
 strength tests, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle behaviors. The second 
 set of independent variables (threshold variables) are used to model cut-points 
 between adjacent self-reported response categories as functions of individual 
 characteristics, i.e., it adjusts for socio-demographic and cultural differences
 in how the continuous latent health is projected onto the ordinal self-rated 
 measure. These threshold variables could include, for example, gender, age 
 group, education, and country (Oksuzyan et al. 2019 
 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002>).
 The fitted model can be use to calculate individual latent status variable, 
 which is a aproxy of the true status. In case of the self-reported health, the 
 predicted latent health can be standardized to the health index, which varies 
 from 0 representing the (model-based) worst health state to 1 representing the 
 (model-based) best health in the sample. The standardized latent coefficients 
 (disability weights for the self-rated health case) provide information about 
 the individual impact of the specific latent (e.g., health) variables on the 
 latent (e.g., health) construct, for example, the extent to which latent health 
 index is reduced by the presence of Parkinson’s disease, poor mobility, and 
 other specific health measures (Jurges 2007 <doi:10.1002/hec.1134>; 
 Oksuzyan et al. 2019 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002>).
 The latent index can be used to reclassify categorical status measure that is 
 adjusted for inter-individual differences in reporting behavior. 
 The two methods are available: (1) based on model estimated cut-points or (2) 
 a method based on percentiles of original categorical response distribution - 
 Jurges’ method (Jurges 2007 <doi:10.1002/hec.1134>; 
 Oksuzyan et al. 2019 <doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.002>).
